Summary: 

This paper is based on an online survey conducted among translation professionals, aiming to explore how professionals conduct their work, the needs they experience, and the tools and resources they resort to when translating. Specifically, the survey looks at how participants use Wikipedia and analyses their perceptions of this tool. The survey results suggest that respondents made extensive use of all sorts of technologies when translating, and they resorted to human resources to meet their needs. Respondents had a good overall opinion of Wikipedia and most of them reported using it when translating. However, some results suggest the existence of some kind of controversy or censorship with regard to the use of Wikipedia in professional contexts. The majority of respondents access Wikipedia through search page results, and they use Wikipedia for a variety of purposes, including documentation, terminology, and visual aspects. Respondents also noted the cultural dimension of Wikipedia and its usefulness in finding the meaning of cultural references. The survey also reveals that translation professionals use Wikipedia as consumers but do not always admit it, highlighting the online encyclopaedia's cultural and visual potential.
The survey discussed in this paper explores the tools and resources used by translation professionals and their perception and use of Wikipedia. While the survey has some limitations, such as language/country bias and a limited scope, it has qualitative value in documenting a little-studied reality. Respondents' most popular tools/resources include Google, online dictionaries/corpora, terminology databases, image-search engines, and human-driven resources. Translation memories (TMs) are not seen as a pressing need, and machine translation has low acceptance, possibly because of the nature of the sample, mostly freelance translators. Most respondents reported accessing Wikipedia from search engine results, not through a pre-planned strategy. Respondents use Wikipedia to solve their immediate needs related to documentation and terminological, lexicographical, and visual aspects. They perceive Wikipedia as useful, reliable, and easy to use, but they compare its information with other sources.

Summary: 

This paper discusses the changing attitude of academics towards Wikipedia as a source of knowledge, from being considered a low-quality source and a synonym for plagiarism to being recognized as a valuable teaching tool. The focus of this paper is on the use of Wikipedia as a tool to support translation training at the university level and to help students develop a broad range of translation competences, based on the 2017 EMT competence framework requirements. Although there are objections to using Wikipedia due to its reputation for unreliability and subjectivity, it can also be approached as a concept for inclusive participation, incorporating the idea of online sharing and collaboration. Despite the initial negative attitude of academia towards Wikipedia, its presence in academic research is growing, and it is the most popular reference source on the web, with more than 87% of students reporting its use. This paper explores the advantages of using Wikipedia as a teaching tool for translation students. This also discusses various models of translation competence, including the PACTE research group model, the EMT "Wheel of Competence" model, and the model of translation competence acquisition to find how Wikipedia-based assignments can contribute to the development of translator competence in various areas, including language and culture, translation, technology, personal and interpersonal competence, and service provision. The Paper concludes by discussing the potential benefits of incorporating Wikipedia-based activities into translation training programs.
This paper mentioned how Wikipedia-based translation activities can help students develop and master digital literacy skills. It highlights how working on Wikipedia translations requires students to use and rapidly adapt to new tools and learn Wiki markup code and selected HTML elements. The students are required to correctly structure their articles with the use of Wikicode and equip them with valid links to references. They have to work in an unfamiliar environment and master elements of programming. This paper also includes how working on Wikipedia translations can help students develop personal and interpersonal competencies, such as collaboration online, following online etiquette, and participating in a large-scale project. It also discusses how Wikipedia can be used as a resource for translation trainers to provide their students with genuine translation tasks, allowing them to practice and develop their translation competence. The platform offers multiple modes of working, including individual work, online collaboration, and group activities, making it a versatile platform for translation practice. However, trainers need to be up-to-date with the latest changes in the platform and ensure that their students have access to the appropriate equipment and a stable Internet connection. Despite these challenges, the use of Wikipedia as a translation practice tool can be a highly valuable option for translation trainers at the university level.

Summary:

The article "Wikipedia Culture Gap: Quantifying Content Imbalances Across 40 Language Editions" analyzes the content of 40 language editions of Wikipedia, investigating the imbalance of articles related to cultural topics. The authors developed a metric called the Culture Gap Index to quantify the differences in coverage of cultural topics across different language editions of Wikipedia.
The study found that there is a significant imbalance in the representation of cultural content across different language editions of Wikipedia. To quantify this imbalance, the authors use data from Wikidata to identify articles that are present in one language edition of Wikipedia but not in others. They then use a statistical method to identify articles that are overrepresented or underrepresented in a particular language edition, relative to the expected distribution of articles based on the size of its corresponding language community. The authors find that there is a significant variation in the coverage of different topics across language editions, with some topics being overrepresented in certain editions and underrepresented in others. They also find that smaller language editions tend to have a more imbalanced distribution of content, with fewer articles overall and a smaller proportion of high-quality articles.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of addressing the cultural and linguistic imbalances on Wikipedia in order to promote more equitable access to knowledge for people around the world.
